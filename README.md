Ephemeral Open Location Network Proof of Concept
================================================

Open Location Network is a flexible idea that this projects intends to bootstrap by giving an example of and proving the basic concepts of the idea. The Ephemeral in the name means that it doesn't try to be persistent in any way, so you shouldn't in any way use it to save any information. This project is for development of concepts, not for storage and I will actively try to avoid storing anything.

So what is Open Location Network? Short OLN (and you can also replace the L with Listening) its goal is to create an open source P2P internet backchannel ad-hoc protocol of sorts that grows with our concept of what the internet is. The idea is that you can pass new messages through to other participants in the network and any participant can index them any way it wants and enable people to search for what they need.

What would you index on? Anything that is or will be a standardized way to refer to things. E.g. hashtags for things we talk about, URLs to relate messages to parts of the internet, timestamps and of course the Location part, plustags.

Plustags is my name for the idea of using Google's pluscodes as some kind of hashtags for location. My idea with OLN is to make it possible to find messages that are relevant for you based on subject and location, and be completely oblivious of the rest of things that go on. And of course the participants in the network should be able to be fully opinionated about what they index etc, for example things that relate to specific subjects and/or regions.

Anyone is free to help. How to help? Just create anything that would make any of these ideas closer to reality, or develop upon these ideas to make something cool yourself. What would you do if the internet had a backchannel that is open to whispering anything to anyone willing to listen? That's why OLN can just as well mean Open Listening Network.
